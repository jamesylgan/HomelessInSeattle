# Homeless in Seattle Inc.
## About this Project: 

This project was made in under 24 hours at DubHacks 2018 and was created in order to help inform the general public and increase the the general understanding of the severity of the homeless population in the Seattle Area.

We hope to provide a platform which uses powerful visualizaitons to help others understand why this issue must be addressed. Our application also serves as a platform where users can donate to underserved areas in Seattle. Users will want to donate on our platform compared to others as we plan on making our annual reports publicly available - detailing which populations we are directly affecting in the community. We plan to convey this using detailed and powerful data visualizations.

Besides having the sense of directly impacting the surrounding community through their contributions, users will also want to use our platform as they will experience tax breaks from their contributions and regularly be updated about the people they are directly informing through our site which we plan on regularly updating.

So, in summary: our application aims to inform and engage the community to actively make a change based on powerful data visualizations on a social problem which thoroughly needs to be addressed.
